<h1>Hello Coursera! It's a great course! what is up world I guess nothing. Is this going to update in real time? I finally got the browser sync to work again...not sure what is going on. will figure it out I guess if you use the browser sync the intent is to update everything through the sublime and to view the browser so you know it is updating to your standard. Then the final step is to push it to the git hub to update the repository with all changes. Can I add emojis?</h1>
